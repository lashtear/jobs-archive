# Jobs Archive

An archiving tool for [Anomaly Jobs](http://code.google.com/p/anomalyjobs/) and [phpBB3](http://www.phpbb.com/) on [TinyMux 2.10](http://code.google.com/p/tinymux/).

This can be used for general forum posting from within the MUX, but is targetted at permanent archival of completed jobs.

Originally produced for [The Reach](http://thereachmux.org/)

## Primary interfaces:
   
* fn_post_new_topic
* fn_post_reply
* fn_simple_post_new_topic
* fn_simple_post_reply
* fn_post_job

## Compatibility

Very little, currently, but feedback and patches are welcome.  We have this working with:

* Anomaly Jobs 6.4 + a lot of patches
* phpBB 3.0
* TinyMux 2.10 + [a few patches](https://github.com/lashtear/tinymux/tree/thereach)
* MySQL 5.1

Source code is provided in the format of the general MUSH unformatter tools that we all use; attributes must be unwrapped before feeding into the MUX.

## Acknowledgements

The idea of archiving AJ's completed jobs to a permanent forum was originally [Loki](http://github.com/kkragenbrink)'s (Nuitari@DLAoM), and he completed working versions on DragonLance: Age of Mortals MUSH and [Haunted Memories: Vienna by Night](http://www.haunted-memories.net/) for AJ5 and SMF.

This project is an effort to provide similar functionality for newer software on a different mush-- and make it more portable and available to others.
